# xboxdrv Examples

Welcome to the xboxdrv examples repository.

## Description

Why did I make this? As someone who uses xboxdrv and Linux, I feel I would like to let anyone who wants to use them as well to also use these useful (debatable) configs.

## How to Download

It is highly suggested to `git clone http://github.com/Chewsterchew/xboxdrv-examples.git` because it is very easy to `git pull` and update all projects with one command, but if you cannot use Git for whatever reason, simply direct download.

## How to Run

To run a .xboxdrv file, follow these steps.

1) Open Terminal (CTRL+ALT+T)

2) Type or paste this: `xboxdrv --silent --config ` <-- that space is important!

3) Find the location of the downloaded .xboxdrv file and drag it into the terminal.

4) Hit Enter

If this doesn't work, replace step 2 with `sudo xboxdrv --silent --config ` then follow steps 3 and 4 normally.

If it STILL does not work, send an issue.

## How to Update a file(s)

If you're using git, open a terminal, navigate to the git folder, type `git pull`
, you're done. Congratulations.

Otherwise, go back to where you originally downloaded the file and download it again, then follow the run steps as normal.
